# Instance-level Scale Match (SM+)

------------------------
## Introduction
we investigate the scale alignment between pre-training and target datasets, and propose a new refined Scale Match method (termed SM+) for tiny person detection. SM+ improves the scale match from image level to instance level, and effectively promotes the similarity between pre-training dataset and target dataset.
